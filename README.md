# Hedera State Consensus ZK PoC
## Dependencies

First, [install Rust] and [Foundry], and then restart your terminal.

```sh
# Install Rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, you will need to install the `cargo risczero` tool.
We'll use [`cargo binstall`][cargo-binstall] to get `cargo-risczero` installed, and then install the `risc0` toolchain.
See [RISC Zero installation] for more details.

```sh
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-risczero
cargo risczero install
```

Now you have all the tools you need to develop and deploy an application with [RISC Zero].

## Quick Start

First, install the RISC Zero toolchain using the [instructions above](#dependencies).

Update submodules with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build the Code

- Builds for zkVM program, the publisher app, and any other Rust code.

  ```sh
  cargo build
  ```

- Build your Solidity smart contracts

  > NOTE: `cargo build` needs to run first to generate the `ImageID.sol` contract.

  ```sh
  forge build
  ```

### Run the Tests

- Tests your zkVM program.

  ```sh
  cargo test
  ```

- Test your Solidity contracts, integrated with your zkVM program.

  ```sh
  RISC0_DEV_MODE=true forge test -vvv 
  ```

### Configuring Bonsai

***Note:*** *To request an API key [complete the form here](https://bonsai.xyz/apply).*

With the Bonsai proving service, you can produce a [Groth16 SNARK proof] that is verifiable on-chain.
You can get started by setting the following environment variables with your API key and associated URL.

```bash
export BONSAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" # see form linked above
export BONSAI_API_URL="BONSAI_URL" # provided with your api key
```

Alternatively, there is a .env.example with the same variables. Rename the file to .env, fill in the values and apply the changes using
```bash
source .env
```

If you run `forge test`, the test will be fully verifying `RiscZeroGroth16Verifier` and will request a SNARK receipt from Bonsai.

```bash
forge test -vvv
```
